# Benchmark `sched_v3_fixed_t4_cranfield`

Architecture **multi**, mode **realtime** (tick 4.0 s), overlay `configs/v3.yaml,configs/cranfield.yaml,configs/sched_study.yaml`, merge rule `hybrid`, models npu: `Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_0-pure-embq8.gguf`, cpu: `Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_0-pure-embq8.gguf`. Agent code ran on the laptop and only model calls on the board, so tick times are laptop times. Energy not measured. Plant data: REAL rig data (Cranfield three-phase flow facility, Ruiz-Carcel et al. 2015).

Group top-1 is the share of scored ticks (fault onset onward) whose published rank-1 cause is in the true case's look-alike group; belief group top-1 is the same for the code-only ranking. A held-out true case has no exact top-1. Unusable = a model answer that was not used (wrong format, failed call, rejected note reading). Settings and every run, stopped ones included: `test.json`.

Board resources (on-board sampler, once a second, per episode): CPU seconds and peak memory of each model server. The NPU has no readable usage counter; its work shows as the NPU lane's call time. Supply power, if the board exposes it, is in each summary's `meta.resources`; energy is never estimated.
